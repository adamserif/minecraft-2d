## Tile Heaven - A 2D Minecraft Clone 

A game demo reminiscient of Minecraft coded in approximately one hour using Python 3.6 and the pygame library, made for learning purposes.

Extensions include:
- Implementing sound effects and music
- Creating a main menu screen with options
- Adding more animations
